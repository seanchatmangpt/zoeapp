# Micro-Frontend Federation Deep Dive

## 1. Overview

The Zoe Framework leverages a next-generation **Micro-Frontend (MFE) Federation** architecture designed for the 2030 Innovation Peak. This system allows for the dynamic orchestration of independent React Native modules, enabling seamless integration of remote capabilities while maintaining strict isolation, security, and performance.

By adhering to the **Receipted Chatman Equation** ($R \vdash A = \mu(O^*)$), Zoe ensures that every federated module is a lawful projection of the system's ontology, verified through cryptographic receipts.

## 2. Core Modules

The MFE federation logic is split into two primary domains:

### 2.1 Core Federation (`src/framework/core/micro-frontend`)
This module provides the low-level primitives for loading and rendering federated components.
- **`FederatedComponent`**: The primary UI boundary for remote modules.
- **`useModuleFederation`**: A high-level hook for managing the lifecycle of remote bundles.
- **`types.ts`**: Definitive interfaces for federation configuration and state.

### 2.2 Platform Orchestration (`src/framework/compositions/platform-orchestration`)
This module manages the system-wide orchestration and lifecycle of federated modules.
- **`PlatformKernel`**: The central "brain" that monitors app state and triggers proactive pre-loading and isolation strategies.

## 3. 2030-Standard Module Federation

In the 2030 standard, Module Federation for React Native transcends simple bundle loading. It incorporates:

- **Dynamic Bundle Resolution**: Bundles are resolved at runtime based on the environment, user trust scores, and device capabilities.
- **Lawful Closure Enforcement**: Remote modules must prove they conform to the system's `O*` (Ontology) before execution.
- **Post-Quantum Verification**: All remote entry points are signed with post-quantum primitives (e.g., Dilithium-5) to prevent supply-chain attacks.

## 4. PlatformKernel: Orchestration & Isolation

The `PlatformKernel` serves as the high-integrity membrane for the MFE ecosystem.

### 4.1 Dynamic Bundle Loading
`PlatformKernel` manages a registry of remote modules. It uses `useModuleFederation` to resolve and execute bundles only when needed or based on predictive intent.

### 4.2 Error Isolation (Sandboxing)
Each federated module is executed within a virtualized sandbox. If a remote module crashes or violates an invariant, the `PlatformKernel` catches the error, isolates the faulty module, and prevents it from affecting the core system or other MFEs.

### 4.3 Pre-loading Strategies
To achieve **0ms Latency**, `PlatformKernel` implements several pre-loading strategies:
- **Eager Pre-loading**: Common modules are loaded during app initialization.
- **Contextual Pre-loading**: Modules are loaded based on the current navigation stack or application state (e.g., loading the "Payment" MFE when the user enters the "Checkout" flow).
- **Predictive Pre-loading**: Using the **Predictive Action Layer (PAL)**, the kernel anticipates the next user action and pre-fetches the required remote bundles.

## 5. FederatedComponent

The `FederatedComponent` is the standard way to consume remote modules in the Zoe Framework.

### API Contract
```typescript
interface FederatedComponentProps {
  name: string;      // Unique name of the remote container
  url: string;       // URL of the remote JS bundle
  scope: string;     // Remote scope/namespace
  module: string;    // Specific module to export (e.g., './Widget')
  fallback?: ReactNode; // Rendered during loading
  errorComponent?: ReactNode | ((err: Error) => ReactNode); // Rendered on failure
  props?: Record<string, any>; // Props passed to the remote component
}
```

### Usage Example

```tsx
import { FederatedComponent } from '@zoe/framework/core/micro-frontend';
import { ActivityIndicator, Text } from 'react-native';

const RemoteWidget = () => (
  <FederatedComponent
    name="AnalyticsModule"
    url="https://cdn.zoe.zone/analytics/v1/remoteEntry.js"
    scope="analytics"
    module="./DashboardCard"
    fallback={<ActivityIndicator size="large" />}
    errorComponent={(error) => (
      <Text style={{ color: 'red' }}>
        Failed to load Analytics: {error.message}
      </Text>
    )}
    props={{
      timeframe: '7d',
      onDataRefresh: () => console.log('Data refreshed'),
    }}
  />
);
```

## 6. Best Practices

1. **Strict Typing**: Always define and share types for props passed between host and remote modules.
2. **Granular Fallbacks**: Provide meaningful fallback UI to maintain a fluid UX during bundle loading.
3. **Lazy Orchestration**: Only include `FederatedComponent` in the render tree when necessary to preserve memory and battery life.
4. **Invariant Protection**: Use the `AutonomousRepairAgent` within MFEs to ensure local state consistency before emitting events to the host.
