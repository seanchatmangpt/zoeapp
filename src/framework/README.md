# Zoe Framework SDK: The 2030 Innovation Peak

Welcome to the master entry point for the **Zoe Framework SDK**. This is the architectural foundation of the Zoe ecosystem, engineered to deliver next-generation execution trust, generative interfaces, and post-quantum security.

The Zoe Framework is not merely a library; it is an **active operational membrane** that bridge the gap between human intent and machine execution through the lens of the **2030 Innovation Peak**.

## 🚀 Quick Start: The `Zoe2030` Ultimate Wrapper

The `Zoe2030` provider is the singular entry point required to activate the full suite of 2030 capabilities. It orchestrates the on-device LLM engines, predictive action layers, and generative UI systems.

### 1. Wrap Your Application
At the root of your React Native or Web application, wrap your component tree with the `<Zoe2030 />` provider.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Zoe2030 } from '@/src/framework/2030/core';
import { myLocalLLMEngine } from './engines';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Zoe2030 inferenceEngine={myLocalLLMEngine}>
      <RootNavigator />
    </Zoe2030>
  );
};
```

### 2. Access the Unified Suite
Use the `useZoe2030()` hook to access sub-engines and framework state from any child component.

```tsx
import { useZoe2030 } from '@/src/framework/2030/core';

const Dashboard = () => {
  const { genEx, predictive, version } = useZoe2030();

  // Trigger a predictive intent ingestion
  const handleAction = async (intent) => {
    await predictive.ingestIntent(intent);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Zoe Framework v{version}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

## 🏛️ 2030 Innovation Best Practices (Manifesto Summary)

The Zoe Framework is built upon the **Receipted Chatman Equation**: $R \vdash A = \mu(O^*)$. To build 2030-compliant applications, developers must adhere to these four pillars:

1.  **Lawful Closure ($O^*$):** Every admissible state must be defined within the Lawful Closure Ontology. If a state transition is not explicitly permitted, it is physically impossible to reach.
2.  **Manufacturing Function ($\mu$):** UI and system consequences are never "rendered"; they are *manufactured* by transforming user intent through the lens of the ontology.
3.  **Receipted Execution ($R \vdash A$):** Every action ($A$) must be accompanied by a cryptographic receipt ($R$) proving safety, provenance, and conformance.
4.  **Ambient Self-Healing:** Systems must include autonomous QA agents that monitor state perturbations and automatically apply repair strategies to maintain invariant parity.

## 🌌 The Vision

The future of software is not a series of buttons and screens; it is a collaborative, high-trust environment where the interface disappears, leaving only the seamless flow of intent and consequence. By adopting the Zoe Framework SDK, you are not just building an app—you are weaving a piece of the global **Collaborative Intelligence** fabric.

**"The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it."** — *Zoe 2030 Vision*
