//! Evidence — a value carried together with its lifecycle stage and witness.
//!
//! [`Evidence<T, State, W>`] is the universal carrier in this crate. It bundles:
//!
//! - `T`     — the underlying shape (an event log, an OCEL log, a Petri net, …),
//! - `State` — *where it is* in the lifecycle ([`crate::state::Raw`],
//!   [`crate::state::Admitted`], …), as a `PhantomData` tag,
//! - `W`     — *which authority it answers to* ([`crate::witness::Witness`]),
//!   also a `PhantomData` tag.
//!
//! Because `State` and `W` are type parameters, `Evidence<T, Raw, W>` and
//! `Evidence<T, Admitted, W>` are **different types**. A function that demands
//! admitted evidence cannot be called with raw evidence — the boundary law is
//! enforced by the type system, at zero runtime cost.
//!
//! ## The one-way door
//!
//! You may freely build [`Evidence::raw`]. You may **not** freely turn a `Raw`
//! into an `Admitted`: there is no public `Raw → Admitted` conversion here. The
//! *only* path to `Admitted` is through an [`crate::admission::Admit`] impl,
//! which must return a *named* [`crate::admission::Refusal`] when it declines.
//! See the diagnostic [`crate::diagnostic::CompatDiagnostic::RawEvidenceExportedAsAdmitted`].
//!
//! This type is **structure only**. It transports and tags evidence; it never
//! discovers, conforms, replays, or optimizes. Graduate to `wasm4pm` to act on
//! evidence rather than merely carry it.
