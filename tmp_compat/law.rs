//! Compile-time law kernel — `ConstParamTy` enums, bounds machinery, and
//! type-level invariants derived from process-mining papers and the Blue River
//! Dam covenant.
//!
//! ## What this module **IS**
//!
//! The machine room for this crate's nightly type law:
//!
//! - [`Assert`] / [`IsTrue`] / [`Require`] — the "must be true" compile-time
//!   gate. Any where-bound `Require<{ EXPR }>: IsTrue` becomes a compile error
//!   when `EXPR` evaluates to `false`. Requires `generic_const_exprs`.
//! - [`ConditionCell<BITS>`] — the *Need9 means split* law: at most 8 primary
//!   condition bits. `ConditionCell<9>` does **not compile**.
//! - [`Between01<NUM, DEN>`] — metrics that are provably in `[0, 1]` at the
//!   type level. `Between01<2, 1>` does **not compile**.
//! - [`ConstParamTy`] enum set — every lawful state, mode, law, and kind
//!   that travels as a const generic parameter across this crate.
//!
//! ## What this module is **NOT**
//!
//! - **Not** a runtime type; every item here is zero-cost or phantom.
//! - **Not** an engine. Nothing here discovers, replays, or conforms.
//!
//! ## Graduation
//!
//! This module has no graduation path — it is purely structural law. The types
//! that USE these laws graduate to `wasm4pm`.
