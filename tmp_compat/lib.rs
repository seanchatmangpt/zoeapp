//! # wasm4pm-compat
//!
//! A **nightly-only, paper-complete, structure-only** Rust process-evidence
//! standard.
//!
//! > **Start with compatibility. Graduate to execution.**
//!
//! ## Nightly requirement
//!
//! This crate **requires nightly Rust** unconditionally. The `rust-toolchain.toml`
//! pins the toolchain to nightly. The following features are declared at the
//! crate root with no cfg gate:
//!
//! - `generic_const_exprs` — law machinery and `WfNetConst<SOUNDNESS>`
//! - `adt_const_params` — `ConditionCell<BITS>`, `Between01<NUM,DEN>`, and
//!   `Metric<KIND,NUM,DEN>`
//! - `const_trait_impl` — compile-time trait dispatch in law surfaces
//! - `min_specialization` — type-law narrowing in `nightly_foundry`
//! - `portable_simd` — SIMD-width type-law surface in `nightly_foundry`
//!
//! There is no stable build target and no MSRV. Applications must conform
//! *upward* to the type law, not the other way around.
//!
//! ## What this crate IS
//!
//! - A *structure-only* standard: the **shape** of process evidence and the
//!   **laws** of admission, refusal, and lossy projection.
//! - A boundary layer: external formats are admitted into typed compat values,
//!   then exported back out (or graduated to `wasm4pm`) — never laundered
//!   raw-to-raw.
//! - A place where **refusal is first-class**: every serious surface refuses
//!   with a *specific named law* (e.g. `DanglingEventObjectLink`,
//!   `MissingFinalMarking`, `UnsoundWfNet`), never a bare `InvalidInput`.
//! - Built from **small, transparent, strongly-named types**: `PhantomData`
//!   witness/state markers and zero-cost `#[repr(transparent)]` ID wrappers.
//!
//! ## What this crate is NOT
//!
//! - **Not** a lite version of `wasm4pm`. It contains **no engines**: no
//!   discovery, no conformance checking, no replay, no alignment, no
//!   optimization, no visualization.
//! - **Not** a data-laundering tool. Lossy projection always requires a named
//!   projection, a [`loss::LossPolicy`], a [`loss::LossReport`], and a refusal
//!   path.
//!
//! ## The one-way door
//!
//! The central invariant is a typed, one-way lifecycle enforced by the type system:
//!
//! ```text
//! Raw ──parse──▶ Parsed ──admit──▶ Admitted ──▶ {Projected | Exportable | Receipted}
//!   │                                  ▲
//!   └────────────── refuse ────────────┴──▶ Refused  (terminal; carries a named law)
//! ```
//!
//! [`evidence::Evidence<T, State, W>`] is the universal carrier. `State` and `W`
//! are zero-sized `PhantomData` tags — zero runtime cost. `Evidence<T, Raw, W>` and
//! `Evidence<T, Admitted, W>` are **different types**. A function demanding admitted
//! evidence cannot be called with raw evidence. The `Admitted` constructor is
//! `pub(crate)` — the **only** public path to admitted evidence is
//! [`admission::Admit::admit`].
//!
//! ## Feature model
//!
//! The public feature surface is **exactly three**. They control *capability
//! stages*, not *canon knowledge* — the base profile already knows every shape.
//!
//! | Feature    | Default | Meaning                                                        |
//! |------------|:-------:|----------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `formats`  |   yes   | import/export contracts, round-trip claims, loss surfaces      |
//! | `strict`   |   no    | opt-in boundary judgment: strict admission/refusal surfaces    |
//! | `wasm4pm`  |   no    | graduation bridge traits toward the `wasm4pm` execution engine |
//!
//! There are **no per-format flags** (no `ocel`/`xes`/`bpmn`/…). Nightly is
//! **not** a Cargo feature: the crate requires nightly unconditionally.
//! `nightly_foundry.rs` is a staging module that is always on.
//!
//! ## Test surfaces
//!
//! Three distinct surfaces with different purposes and cadences:
//!
//! - **Fast loop** — `cargo test --all-features --tests`: unit and integration
//!   tests; sub-second after the initial build. Run on every change.
//! - **ALIVE gate** — `cargo test --test ui_tests -- --ignored`: trybuild
//!   compile-fail and compile-pass fixtures that certify the type law. Explicit
//!   opt-in; ~4 min cold. A compile-fail fixture failing for the *wrong* reason
//!   is not a valid type-law receipt.
//! - **Documentation audit** — `cargo test --doc --all-features`: verifies
//!   every public doctest compiles. Explicit opt-in; slow on nightly (each
//!   doctest touching nightly features is a separate `rustc` invocation).
//!
//! Doctests are **disabled** in the default test run (`doctest = false` in
//! `Cargo.toml`) to keep the dev loop fast.
//!
//! ## Adoption example
//!
//! Build the core event-log shape via the [`prelude`]:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use wasm4pm_compat::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Build a single event, fold it into a trace, and a trace into a log.
//! let event = Event::new("place_order");
//! let trace = Trace::from_events([event]);
//! let log = EventLog::from_traces([trace]);
//! assert_eq!(log.trace_count(), 1);
//! ```
//!
//! The full `Raw → Admitted` path:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use wasm4pm_compat::admission::{Admit, Admission, Refusal};
//! use wasm4pm_compat::evidence::Evidence;
//! use wasm4pm_compat::state::Raw;
//! use wasm4pm_compat::witness::Ocel20;
//!
//! enum LinkedOcel {}
//!
//! impl Admit for LinkedOcel {
//!     type Raw = bool;
//!     type Admitted = bool;
//!     type Reason = &'static str;
//!     type Witness = Ocel20;
//!     fn admit(raw: Evidence<bool, Raw, Ocel20>)
//!         -> Result<Admission<bool, Ocel20>, Refusal<&'static str, Ocel20>>
//!     {
//!         if raw.value { Ok(Admission::new(true)) }
//!         else { Err(Refusal::new("DanglingEventObjectLink")) }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let admitted = LinkedOcel::admit(Evidence::raw(true)).unwrap().into_evidence();
//! let exportable = admitted.into_exportable();
//! assert_eq!(exportable.value, true);
//! ```
//!
//! Examples are `ignore`d here; see the `examples/` directory for runnable
//! walkthroughs of each capability stage.
//!
//! ## Graduation path
//!
//! When you need to *run* something — discover a model, check conformance, replay a
//! log — you graduate. With the `wasm4pm` feature, bridge traits hand your typed
//! compat evidence to the execution engine. The compat crate stays structure-only;
//! the engine does the work.
