//! Causal net structural shapes — Weijters & Ribeiro (2011) Heuristics Miner output.
//!
//! A *causal net* (C-net) is a graph model produced by the Heuristics Miner
//! algorithm (Weijters & Ribeiro, 2011). Unlike a Petri net, arcs in a C-net
//! carry *dependency measures* (floating-point scores in [0, 1]) that reflect
//! the observed causal strength between activities in an event log.
//!
//! Each task in a C-net is associated with a set of *input bindings* and a set
//! of *output bindings* — structured conjunctions and disjunctions of
//! predecessor/successor tasks. A binding records *which combination* of
//! incoming (or outgoing) arcs activates (or is produced by) the task.
//!
//! ## What this module IS
//!
//! - The **shape** of a causal net: nodes, arcs, dependency scores, and bindings.
//! - Structure-only: no mining, no score computation, no replay. Heuristics Miner
//!   execution graduates to `wasm4pm`.
//!
//! ## What this module is **NOT**
//!
//! - Not a miner. `CausalNet` is the *output shape* of Heuristics Miner, not the
//!   miner itself.
//! - Not an executable graph. `DependencyMeasure` is a score annotation; no arc
//!   fires, and no binding is evaluated here.
//!
//! ## Graduation to `wasm4pm`
//!
//! Dependency measure computation (the ≥2, ≥3, and long-distance dependency
//! heuristics), binding-set construction, replay, and conformance checking all
//! graduate to `wasm4pm`.
