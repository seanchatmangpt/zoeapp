//! Always-on **adoption grammar** for interoperating with external process-mining
//! ecosystems (PM4Py, PMAx, and friends) — *without* cloning their internals.
//!
//! This module is the smallest, always-available vocabulary a host tool needs to
//! describe what it is *handing across the boundary* and what it is *claiming*
//! about that handoff. It is **structure only**: it carries no PM4Py objects, runs
//! no discovery, no conformance checking, no replay, and no statistics. It merely
//! lets an adopter *name* the shapes it intends to admit, and *refuse* — with a
//! specific named law — when a claim is not grounded.
//!
//! ## What this module **IS**
//!
//! - A set of small, transparent *shape descriptors* ([`Pm4pyShape`],
//!   [`FilterShape`], [`SummaryShape`], [`ConformanceTriple`]) that describe the
//!   *kind* of artifact being adopted, never its bytes or its computed values.
//! - An [`ArtifactGrounding`] that ties a claimed artifact to the evidence that
//!   justifies admitting it.
//! - A first-class refusal enum, [`InteropRefusal`], for when a claim cannot be
//!   grounded.
//!
//! ## What this module is **NOT**
//!
//! - **Not** a PM4Py / PMAx re-implementation. There are no DataFrames, no
//!   PetriNet objects, no alignment matrices here.
//! - **Not** an engine. Nothing here *computes* a summary, a filter result, or a
//!   conformance triple — it only describes their *shape* so the boundary can
//!   reason about admission and refusal.
//!
//! ## Graduation
//!
//! These descriptors should graduate to `wasm4pm` the moment a host needs the
//! values behind them *computed or executed* (an actual filter applied, an actual
//! summary tallied, an actual conformance triple measured). At that point the
//! shape becomes a job, and a job belongs to the engine — see the `wasm4pm`
//! feature and the `graduation` module.

///

/// evidence ref), use `wasm4pm_compat::graduation::GraduateToWasm4pm`

/// compile-time surface that `GraduateToWasm4pm` implementors should also
/// implement at the seam.
///
/// ## Usage pattern
///
/// ```
/// use wasm4pm_compat::interop::{GraduationCandidate, graduation_seal};
///
/// struct PendingOcelDiscovery;
///
/// impl graduation_seal::Sealed for PendingOcelDiscovery {}
/// impl GraduationCandidate for PendingOcelDiscovery {}
///
/// fn only_graduation_candidates<T: GraduationCandidate>(_: &T) {}
/// only_graduation_candidates(&PendingOcelDiscovery);
/// ```

// ── Compile-time filter-shape law ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `FilterShapeConst<IS_OC>` is the type-level surface for the pm4py shape law:
// an object-centric filter dimension (ObjectType) must only be applied to an
// object-centric artifact shape.  The boolean const parameter names whether the
// artifact is object-centric.  `assert_filter_oc_compatible` requires the
// sealed `RequiresObjectCentric` bound, which only `FilterShapeConst<true>`
// satisfies — so passing `FilterShapeConst<false>` (a flat artifact) is a
// compile error named `DimensionShapeMismatch`.
//
// Law: DimensionShapeMismatch — FilterShape::ObjectType over a flat Pm4pyShape.

/// A compile-time artifact-centricity tag for the filter-shape law.
///
/// `IS_OC` encodes whether the artifact is object-centric (`true`) or flat
/// (`false`). Pass `FilterShapeConst::<true>` to surfaces that require an
/// object-centric shape; `FilterShapeConst::<false>` fails those surfaces at
/// compile time with the `DimensionShapeMismatch` law.
///
/// This is **structure only** and **zero-cost**: no runtime value is stored.
///
/// ```
/// use wasm4pm_compat::interop::{FilterShapeConst, assert_filter_oc_compatible};
