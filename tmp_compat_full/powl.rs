//! POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) shape — **first-class, structure only**.
//!
//! This module represents the *shape* of a POWL model: a partially ordered
//! workflow built from atoms, partial orders, exclusive choices, and loops,
//! with explicit silent steps. POWL is treated as a **first-class** canon
//! member here — it is **not** forced into [`crate::process_tree`], because POWL
//! can express partial orders that no block-structured process tree can.
//!
//! ## What this module **IS**
//!
//! - The structural vocabulary of POWL: [`PowlNode`], [`OrderEdge`], [`Powl`].
//! - Witness markers describing *which POWL fragment* a node represents
//!   ([`Atom`], [`PartialOrder`], [`Choice`], [`Loop`], [`Silent`],
//!   [`Irreducible`]) and *whether it can graduate downward* into a process
//!   tree ([`ProcessTreeProjectable`], [`ExceedsProcessTree`]).
//! - A first-class [`PowlRefusal`] surface naming exactly why a POWL shape is
//!   inadmissible.
//!
//! ## What this module is **NOT**
//!
//! - **Not** a POWL discovery algorithm, language player, simplifier, or
//!   conformance checker. It builds and refuses *shapes*; it never *executes*
//!   them.
//! - **Not** a process tree in disguise. Projection POWL → process tree is a
//!   *named, refusable* operation, never an implicit coercion.
//!
//! ## Graduation
//!
//! When you need to **replay, discover, simplify, or measure** a POWL model,
//! graduate this shape to the `wasm4pm` engine (via the `wasm4pm` feature):
//! this module only certifies that the *structure* is well-formed and names the
//! law under which it would be refused.

/// Typed marker carrying the **named reason** a POWL projection was refused.
///
/// A POWL projection (e.g. POWL → process tree) that cannot proceed is not
/// an untyped error — it is a *named refusal*. `RefusedProjection<R>` carries
/// the specific [`PowlRefusal`] reason `R` as a zero-cost `PhantomData` type
/// parameter, making the refusal auditable without heap allocation.
///
/// The concrete reason value is carried alongside: callers can inspect both
/// the type-level `R` (for static dispatch) and the runtime `.reason()`.
///
/// Structure-only: a `RefusedProjection` is a verdict, not a recovery tool.
/// Graduate to `wasm4pm` to act on admitted shapes.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use wasm4pm_compat::powl::{RefusedProjection, PowlRefusal};
/// let r = RefusedProjection::new(PowlRefusal::IrreducibleProjection);
/// assert_eq!(r.reason(), &PowlRefusal::IrreducibleProjection);
/// assert_eq!(format!("{}", r), "POWL refused: IrreducibleProjection");

///
/// Kourani, Park & van der Aalst (2026) — Theorem 4.3: a separable WF-net can

/// precondition (`SeparableWfNet`) and produced an equivalent POWL model.

/// `wasm4pm` graduation bridge that performs the actual conversion. It cannot
/// be forged externally.

/// ## Structure-only
///

/// itself is returned separately; this witness travels alongside it as a
