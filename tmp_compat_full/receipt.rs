//! Receipt-**shaped** evidence — **structure only, carries no full authority**.
//!
//! This module represents the *shape* of a receipt: a provenance-bearing
//! envelope that pairs a witness, a content digest, and a replay hint. It is the
//! *form* of evidence, not the *authority* of evidence.
//!
//! ## What this module **IS**
//!
//! - The structural vocabulary of receipts: [`ReceiptShape`], plus the small
//!   transparent [`Digest`] and [`ReplayHint`] carriers.
//! - A first-class [`ReceiptRefusal`] surface naming exactly why a receipt shape
//!   is inadmissible.
//!
//! ## What this module is **NOT**
//!
//! - **Not** a hash function, a signer, a verifier, or a replay engine. A
//!   [`ReceiptShape`] *carries* a digest string and a replay hint produced
//!   elsewhere; it never *computes* a digest or *verifies* a claim.
//! - **Not** authoritative. A well-shaped receipt asserts only that the *form*
//!   of evidence is present — full provenance authority lives in `wasm4pm`.
//!
//! ## Graduation
//!
//! When you need to **compute digests, verify, or replay** receipted evidence,
//! graduate this shape to the `wasm4pm` engine (via the `wasm4pm` feature). This
//! module only certifies that the *receipt form* is well-shaped.

// ── WellShaped trait ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// A uniform shape-checking trait for all receipt types in this module.
///
/// Every receipt type — [`ReceiptShape`], [`ReceiptEnvelope`],
/// [`ReceiptChain`], and [`GraduationReceipt`] — implements `WellShaped`.
/// A caller that holds a `dyn WellShaped` (or `T: WellShaped`) can check
/// structural admissibility without knowing the concrete type.
///
/// This trait is **structure only**: it checks *presence* of required fields,
/// never *authenticity* or *semantic validity*.

/// A graduation event receipt marker: records *that* a value crossed the

///
/// `GraduationReceipt` is the structural proof that a named subject was
/// declared as a graduation candidate. It pairs the compat-layer
/// [`ReceiptEnvelope`] that describes the candidate with the reason key
/// (as a stable `&'static str`) that justified crossing the boundary.

/// ## What this type **IS**
///
/// - A **boundary marker**: it witnesses that a value left the compat layer.
/// - A **structural receipt**: it carries the envelope and the reason tag as
///   plain, inspectable fields; it does nothing with them.
///
/// ## What this type is **NOT**
///
/// - **Not** a graduation action. Holding a `GraduationReceipt` does not
///   perform graduation; it is the record *that* graduation was declared.
/// - **Not** a cryptographic proof. Digest and replay-hint fields are
///   carried, not computed. Graduate to `wasm4pm` for real receipt minting.

/// ## Graduation
///
/// When a host needs to *execute* graduation (routing a candidate into the
