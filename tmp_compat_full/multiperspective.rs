//! # Multi-Perspective Process Evidence
//!
//! Typed shapes for multi-perspective process analysis.
//! The four perspectives of process mining are control-flow, data,
//! resource, and time. This module provides witness markers for each.
//!
//! ## What this module IS
//!
//! - Zero-cost perspective marker types for use in generic bounds and `PhantomData`
//!   positions, following Mannhardt et al. (2016) "Balanced Multi-Perspective
//!   Checking of Process Conformance".
//! - A `MultiPerspectiveEvidence<T, Perspectives>` carrier that threads a
//!   perspective combination through the type system.
//! - Structure only. No alignment computation, no conformance checking.
//!
//! ## What this module is NOT
//!
//! - Not a conformance checker. Per-perspective cost weighting and multi-perspective
//!   alignment execution graduate to `wasm4pm`.
//! - Not a runtime value store. All perspective markers are zero-sized.
//!
//! ## Paper anchor
//!
//! Mannhardt, F., de Leoni, M., Reijers, H. A., & van der Aalst, W. M. P. (2016).
//! "Balanced Multi-Perspective Checking of Process Conformance."
//! *Computing*, 98(4), 407–437.
//!
//! ## Graduation
//!
//! When you need to *compute* per-perspective alignment costs or *check* multi-
//! perspective conformance, graduate to `wasm4pm`.
