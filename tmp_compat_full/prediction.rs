//! Prediction **problem** shape — **structure only, does NOT predict**.
//!
//! This module represents the *shape* of a predictive-process-monitoring
//! problem: a prefix trace plus the kind of target being asked about
//! (next-activity, outcome, remaining-time, drift). It is a **problem
//! statement**, not a predictor.
//!
//! ## What this module **IS**
//!
//! - The structural vocabulary of prediction problems: [`PredictionProblem`]
//!   and the target witness markers [`PrefixTrace`], [`OutcomeLabel`],
//!   [`RemainingTime`], [`NextActivity`], [`DriftSignal`].
//! - A first-class [`PredictionRefusal`] surface naming exactly why a problem
//!   shape is inadmissible.
//!
//! ## What this module is **NOT**
//!
//! - **Not** a model, a feature encoder, a regressor, or a classifier. It states
//!   and refuses *problem shapes*; it never *predicts* an answer.
//!
//! ## Graduation
//!
//! When you need to **train, encode, or run** a predictive model, graduate this
//! problem shape to the `wasm4pm` engine (via the `wasm4pm` feature). This
//! module only certifies that the *problem statement* is well-formed.

// ── Prediction horizon ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// The look-ahead distance for a predictive-process-monitoring problem.
///
/// `PredictionHorizon` classifies *how far ahead* a prediction spans:
///
/// - `FullCase` — the prediction covers the entire remaining case (no fixed
///   bound). This is the default for outcome and remaining-time prediction.
/// - `Events(n)` — the prediction spans exactly `n` future events. Used for
///   next-activity or short-range sequence prediction.
/// - `TimeUnits(secs)` — the prediction spans a real-time window of `secs`
///   seconds ahead. Used for deadline and SLA compliance prediction.
///
/// ## What this is
///
/// A **shape** for the horizon concept: it names what is being asked, it does
/// not compute or enforce the horizon against a log. Graduate to `wasm4pm` for
/// horizon enforcement during prediction.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// `PredictionProblem` stores the horizon as `Option<usize>` (event count) for
/// backward compatibility. `PredictionHorizon` is the richer named type for new
/// surfaces that need to distinguish time-based from event-based horizons.
///
/// ```

///
/// `ComplianceTarget` is a unit-struct phantom witness that identifies the

/// the **operational context** in which compliance is evaluated: is it a live
/// monitoring check, a post-hoc audit, or a regulatory certification sweep?
///
/// ## What this is
///
/// A closed enum for runtime dispatch on compliance context. It travels
/// alongside `PredictionTarget::ComplianceConstraint` as a metadata tag, not
/// as a phantom type parameter.
///
/// ## What this is NOT
///
/// - Not a phantom type witness — use [`ComplianceTarget`] for that.
/// - Not a constraint definition — named rules are a `wasm4pm` concern.
/// - Not an enforcement mechanism — structure only.
///
/// ## Variants
///
/// | Variant | Meaning |
/// |---------|---------|
/// | `Monitoring` | Online / streaming compliance check during case execution. |
/// | `Audit` | Post-hoc audit of a completed or historical case. |
