//! Admission and refusal — the first-class boundary verdict surface.
//!
//! This is where untrusted [`crate::state::Raw`] evidence is judged against a
//! named [`crate::witness::Witness`] and either **admitted** or **refused**.
//! Both outcomes are first-class, strongly-typed values:
//!
//! - [`Admission<T, W>`] — the value crossed the boundary; it may now become
//!   [`crate::state::Admitted`] [`crate::evidence::Evidence`].
//! - [`Refusal<R, W>`] — the value was declined for a **specific named reason**
//!   `R` (e.g. `DanglingEventObjectLink`, `MissingFinalMarking`). A bare
//!   "invalid input" is *not* an acceptable reason here (see
//!   [`docs/REFUSAL_LAW.md`](https://github.com/wasm4pm/wasm4pm-compat/blob/main/docs/REFUSAL_LAW.md)).
//!
//! The [`Admit`] trait ties the two together: it is the **only** sanctioned way
//! to turn `Raw` evidence into `Admitted` evidence. There is no free conversion
//! anywhere else in the crate.
//!
//! This module is **structure only**. An [`Admit`] impl encodes *which named law*
//! gates a boundary; it does not run a discovery/conformance engine. When a
//! boundary needs real verification (token replay, soundness checking, …),
//! graduate it to `wasm4pm`.
