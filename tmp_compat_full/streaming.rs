//! # Streaming Process Evidence
//!
//! Typed shapes for streaming event log evidence — online process monitoring.
//! A streaming evidence surface carries the same type law as batch evidence
//! but with an additional streaming-context marker.
//!
//! ## What this module IS
//!
//! - Structure-only typed markers for online vs. offline evidence collection.
//! - Zero-cost context tags that prevent an online monitoring window from being
//!   silently substituted for an offline analysis log at the type level.
//! - A companion to [`crate::evidence`]: streaming context is orthogonal to the
//!   `Raw → Admitted` lifecycle.
//!
//! ## What this module is NOT
//!
//! - **Not** a streaming runtime. No event ingestion, no window management, no
//!   sliding-window logic. Those concerns graduate to `wasm4pm`.
//! - **Not** a replacement for [`crate::evidence::Evidence`]. Use
//!   `ContextualEvidence<T, Context>` to add a collection-context tag to an
//!   evidence value; the lifecycle law is unchanged.
//!
//! ## Graduation
//!
//! When you need to actually ingest events from a stream, manage windows, or
//! perform online conformance checking, graduate to `wasm4pm`. The context
//! markers here travel with the evidence into the engine.
