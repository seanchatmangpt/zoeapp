//! Witness markers — type-level proof carriers naming the canon a value answers to.
//!
//! A *witness* is a zero-sized marker type that names **which standard, paper,
//! API grammar, Rust law, or internal bridge** a piece of evidence is being
//! admitted, projected, or graduated *against*. Witnesses do not carry data and
//! do not run anything: they exist purely to make the boundary law legible at
//! the type level, so an `Admission<T, Ocel20>` cannot be silently mistaken for
//! an `Admission<T, Xes1849>`.
//!
//! ## What witnesses ARE
//!
//! - Compile-time tags that thread a *named authority* through
//!   [`crate::evidence::Evidence`], [`crate::admission::Admission`], and
//!   [`crate::admission::Refusal`].
//! - Carriers of human-facing metadata ([`Witness::KEY`], [`Witness::TITLE`],
//!   [`Witness::YEAR`], [`Witness::FAMILY`]) so a diagnostic can explain *what*
//!   was being checked.
//!
//! ## What witnesses are **NOT**
//!
//! - **Not** validators. A witness names the authority; it never checks
//!   conformance to it. Checking is an engine concern that belongs in `wasm4pm`,
//!   never in this structure-only crate.
//! - **Not** runtime values. They are empty `enum`s — uninhabited and zero-cost.
//!
//! ## Graduation
//!
//! When a surface stops being a *compatibility* surface and needs to actually
//! verify a standard (e.g. truly check OCEL 2.0 object-event link integrity),
//! the witness travels with the value into `wasm4pm`, where a real engine
//! consumes it. Here, it is only a label.

/// The family a [`Witness`] belongs to — what *kind* of authority it names.
///
/// Families let diagnostics and indexes group witnesses by provenance without
/// hard-coding each marker. This is structure only: a family is a label, not a
/// capability.
