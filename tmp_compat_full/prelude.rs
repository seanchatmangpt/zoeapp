//! The adoption prelude — the smallest surface needed to start using the crate.
//!
//! `use wasm4pm_compat::prelude::*;` brings in the core process-evidence shapes
//! ([`Event`], [`Trace`], [`EventLog`], [`OcelLog`]), the typestate tokens
//! ([`Raw`], [`Parsed`], [`Admitted`], [`Refused`], [`Projected`], [`Exportable`],
//! [`Receipted`]), the witness markers, and the boundary laws (admission,
//! refusal, loss).
//!
//! This prelude re-exports **structure only**. None of these types run
//! discovery, conformance, replay, alignment, or optimization. When you need
//! execution, graduate to the `wasm4pm` engine (see the `wasm4pm` feature).
//!
//! Every path re-exported here is contractually stable — sibling modules are
//! guaranteed to expose exactly these items.
